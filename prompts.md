## 🌈 INTRO SCENE: "This Is (Mostly) True..."

A blank sketchpad rests on a soft carpet in a cozy sunlit bedroom.  
Crayons are scattered like candy — doodles line the walls, plushies peek from every corner.

Suddenly, a red crayon rolls into view and scribbles animated text:

> 🖍️ *"This is a (mostly) true story..."*  
> *"...of one girl, one crayon, and one very curious jet."*

💨 The letters poof into crayon dust.

**🎬 Reveal:**  
A 6-year-old South Asian girl in a yellow hoodie & pigtails smirks at the camera, ready to draw magic.

🧸 Teddy bear with Google-shaped aviator goggles watches beside her.

🎵 *Crayon scribble → sparkle poof → soft giggle → wind-up music*

## ✏️ SCENE 1: **Draw Your Ride!**

**Visuals:**  
The girl confidently sketches her masterpiece: a cartoon jet with cookie engines, rainbow exhaust, googly eyes — and a giraffe in the cockpit.  
She proudly holds it up:  
**“TADAAAA!”**

🎵 *Crayon scribbles → giggle → ta-da jingle*

## ✨ SCENE 2: **Sketch Awakens!**

The drawing glows.  
It lifts off the page, hovers mid-air…

🦾 A bloopy robot voice echoes:  
> *"Uh-oh… unauthorized doodle detected. VEO-3 launch... probably?"*

🧸 Teddy bear tips over in shock.

🎵 *Zap → glitter puff → robotic bleep*

---

## 🚀 SCENE 3: **The Jet Appears — IRL**

✨ The sketchpad explodes in sparkles.  
Suddenly — **GOOGLE JET** lands softly on her carpet!  
Just like the drawing: googly-eyed, cookie-fueled, and rainbow-powered.  
🦒 Giraffe salutes from the cockpit.

> Girl gasps: **“NO. FLIPPING. WAY.”**

🎵 *Crayon pop → doodle woosh → jet blink*

---

## 🎟️ SCENE 4: **Boarding with Crayon Pass**

The jet bounces playfully.  
A glowing red crayon is tossed out — it scribbles itself into a **rainbow staircase**.

👧 Girl turns to teddy:  
> **“Guard the snacks!”**

🎵 *Crayon zips → scribble bloop → stair glitter*

---

## ☁️ SCENE 5: **Lift Off Into the Clouds**

🛫 Inside the jet:  
Candy-colored levers, pink marshmallow seats, rainbow joysticks.

🎮 Girl and Giraffe high-five — then BLAST off through the window.

💨 Trailing sparkles, doodles, and laughter into the skies.

> “Wheeeeeeee!”

🎵 *Jet rumble → magic swoosh → laughter*

## ✨ SCENE 6: **Sky Reveal — It’s VEO!**

Up in the clouds, everything glows in pastel stardust.

🌈 Google logo floats ahead.

🎆 On-screen holo-text:  
**“VEO 3...”**

👧 Girl whispers: **“It’s real…”**  
🦒 Giraffe boops a glowing red button.

## 🍪 BONUS SCENE: **“Snack Route Recalculated”**

Girl gasps:  
> “OH NO… SNACK TIME!”
